## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before using IA invader, ensure the following items are installed:

- **Python 3.7+**  
  The tool is built in Python and requires the following modules:
  - `os`, `time`, `subprocess`, `requests`, `sys`, `threading`, `itertools`

  If you donâ€™t have the *requests* module, install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

- **Ollama API with Mistral Model**  
  The tool uses the Ollama API to generate commands. The default URL is:  
  `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`  
  Ensure the service is running.

- **Llama Pull Mistral with Ollama**  
  To use the **Mistral** model, you need to download and configure **Llama Pull Mistral**. See more details in the [Llama Pull Mistral & Ollama](#llama-pull-mistral--ollama) section below.

- **Security Tools**  
  Depending on the generated commands, you may need tools such as:
  - **Nmap:**  
    - [Download for Windows](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows)  
      or, on Linux:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install nmap
      ```
  - **Nikto:**  
    - [Download for Windows](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)  
      or follow Linux installation instructions.

- **Execution Permissions:**  
  On Windows or when commands require root privileges on Linux, run the script with appropriate permissions.

## Llama Pull Mistral & Ollama

To use the **Mistral** model with IA invader, set up **Llama Pull Mistral** via Ollama:

1. **Install Ollama:**
   - Download the installer for your OS from the [Ollama official website](https://ollama.com/download).
   - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **Verify Ollama installation:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     ollama --version
     ```
   - This should display the installed Ollama version.

3. **Download the Mistral model:**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     ollama pull mistral
     ```
   - This will download and prepare the **Mistral** model for use.

4. **Run the Mistral model:**
   - Start the model with:
     ```bash
     ollama run mistral
     ```
   - This launches an interactive session, allowing the API to use the model for command generation.

5. **Integrate with IA invader:**
   - Ensure the **Mistral** model is running so that the API communication (via `OLLAMA_API_URL`) works properly.
